# Claude Desktop onboarding

Relay wires the Claude Desktop app (third-party gateway mode) onto your LiteLLM AI Gateway so it boots straight into gateway mode with no Claude.ai account and no key handling by the developer.

`relay onboard-claude-desktop` writes the OS-native managed configuration Claude Desktop reads on launch — `/etc/claude-desktop/managed-settings.json` on Linux — pointing inference at the Gateway. The Gateway must implement the Anthropic Messages API (`POST /v1/messages`), which LiteLLM does.

## Single sign-on (recommended)

Each developer signs in with their corporate account; the resulting OIDC token is sent to the Gateway as the bearer credential, so no provider or gateway key lands on the device. Use the same public app registration Relay uses for [Claude Code](claude-code.md#commands) and Codex, and keep Relay's `http://127.0.0.1/callback` redirect URI on it next to the one Claude Desktop uses.

```bash
sudo relay onboard-claude-desktop \
  --gateway-url https://gateway.yourco.com \
  --oidc-client-id "$CLIENT_ID" \
  --oidc-issuer https://login.yourco.com/v2.0
```

## Static key (proof of concept)

Distribute a shared Gateway key instead of SSO.

```bash
sudo relay onboard-claude-desktop \
  --gateway-url https://gateway.yourco.com \
  --api-key sk-your-gateway-key
```

The managed file must be root-owned (Claude Desktop ignores a user-writable one), so run the command with `sudo`. Restart Claude Desktop to pick up the configuration. Because the managed settings are OS-native, this is the surface you push through your MDM — see [mdm.md](mdm.md).

## Usage

The developer only launches Claude Desktop. It opens on the gateway welcome screen ("Your organization has set up Claude to run through a custom inference gateway. No Claude.ai account needed.") and answers through the Gateway.

Claude Desktop and Codex, both onboarded by Relay and answering through one LiteLLM Gateway with zero developer setup:
