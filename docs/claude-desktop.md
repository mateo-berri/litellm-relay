# Claude Desktop onboarding

Relay wires the Claude Desktop app (third-party gateway mode) onto your LiteLLM AI Gateway so it boots straight into gateway mode with no Claude.ai account and no key handling by the developer.

`relay onboard-claude-desktop` writes the OS-native managed configuration Claude Desktop reads on launch, pointing inference at the Gateway: on macOS the `com.anthropic.claudefordesktop` managed preferences domain (`/Library/Managed Preferences/com.anthropic.claudefordesktop.plist`), on Linux `/etc/claude-desktop/managed-settings.json`. The Gateway must implement the Anthropic Messages API (`POST /v1/messages`), which LiteLLM does.

## Single sign-on (recommended)

Each developer signs in with their corporate account; the resulting OIDC token is sent to the Gateway as the bearer credential, so no provider or gateway key lands on the device.

```bash
sudo relay onboard-claude-desktop \
  --gateway-url https://gateway.yourco.com \
  --oidc-client-id "$CLIENT_ID" \
  --oidc-issuer https://login.yourco.com/v2.0
```

## Static key (proof of concept)

Distribute a shared Gateway key instead of SSO.

```bash
sudo relay onboard-claude-desktop \
  --gateway-url https://gateway.yourco.com \
  --api-key sk-your-gateway-key
```

The managed location is root-owned, so run the command with `sudo`. Relay reads the file back after writing and fails instead of reporting success when Claude Desktop could not pick it up. On macOS it also deletes the `/etc/claude-desktop/managed-settings.json` that earlier Relay versions wrote there, a file the macOS app never reads. Restart Claude Desktop to pick up the configuration. Because the managed settings are OS-native, this is the surface you push through your MDM — see [mdm.md](mdm.md).

## Usage

The developer only launches Claude Desktop. It opens on the gateway welcome screen ("Your organization has set up Claude to run through a custom inference gateway. No Claude.ai account needed.") and answers through the Gateway.
