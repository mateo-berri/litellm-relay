# MDM rollout

LiteLLM Relay ships to employee Macs as a signed `.pkg` deployed through your
MDM, plus one configuration profile that points macOS Auto Proxy at Relay's
local PAC URL. Relay is macOS-only today.

Endpoints do **not** need Rust/cargo: the `.pkg` carries a prebuilt binary and
its postinstall installs Relay for the console user (CA trust in the login
keychain + a per-user LaunchAgent). See [`scripts/build-macos-pkg.sh`](../scripts/build-macos-pkg.sh).

Recommended shape, same as other endpoint software: manual pilot on one Mac,
then a small MDM pilot group, then broaden.

## Demo

the PAC configuration profile and the macOS PKG app-add wizard:

## What gets deployed

| Artifact | Purpose | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `litellm-relay-<version>.pkg` | Prebuilt binary + per-user install | Built by `scripts/build-macos-pkg.sh`, attached to the GitHub Release |
| PAC configuration profile | Points macOS Auto Proxy at `http://127.0.0.1:4142/proxy.pac` | [`mdm/litellm-relay-pac.mobileconfig.example`](../mdm/litellm-relay-pac.mobileconfig.example) |
| Managed `config.yaml` | Gateway URL, capture/shadow settings | [`mdm/config.yaml.example`](../mdm/config.yaml.example) |

The managed config can be baked into the `.pkg` at build time
(`--config-file`) so no separate config delivery is needed:

```bash
scripts/build-macos-pkg.sh --version 0.1.0 --config-file mdm/config.yaml.example
```

## Build the package

On a macOS build/release host (or via the Release workflow):

```bash
scripts/build-macos-pkg.sh \
  --version 0.1.0 \
  --config-file mdm/config.yaml.example \
  --sign "Developer ID Installer: Your Company (TEAMID)"
```

Output: `dist/litellm-relay-0.1.0.pkg` plus a printed SHA-256. Signing is
optional for a Jamf-only fleet but required for Intune (Gatekeeper). Tagging a
release (`v*`) also builds the `.pkg` per architecture in
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml).

## Manual pilot (one Mac, no MDM)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiteLLM-Labs/litellm-relay/main/src/install.sh \
  | RELAY_ALLOW_UNPINNED_MAIN=1 bash -s -- --set-system-proxy "Wi-Fi"
```

Dashboard is served locally at `http://127.0.0.1:4142/`. Verify capture without
touching system settings:

```bash
curl --cacert "$(relay ca-path)" -x http://127.0.0.1:4142 https://www.notion.so
```

## Jamf Pro

1. **Upload the package.** Settings → Computer Management → Packages → New (or
   upload via Jamf Admin). Upload `litellm-relay-<version>.pkg`.
2. **Create the deploy policy.** Computers → Policies → New. Add a **Packages**
   payload with the Relay package, action **Install**. Trigger: Recurring
   check-in (or Enrollment Complete). Scope to your **pilot Smart Group** first.
3. **Deploy the PAC profile.** Computers → Configuration Profiles → New. Add a
   **Proxies** payload → Automatic Proxy Configuration → URL
   `http://127.0.0.1:4142/proxy.pac`. Alternatively upload
   [`mdm/litellm-relay-pac.mobileconfig.example`](../mdm/litellm-relay-pac.mobileconfig.example)
   via Upload. Scope to the same pilot group.
4. **Verify.** On a pilot Mac: `launchctl list | grep ai.litellm.relay`, open
   `http://127.0.0.1:4142/`, and confirm requests appear in your LiteLLM
   Gateway. In Jamf, confirm the policy shows Completed.
5. **Broaden.** Expand the Smart Group scope to the full fleet.

## Microsoft Intune

1. **Wrap and upload the app.** The macOS LOB app type takes a `.intunemac`
   file — wrap the signed `.pkg` with the
   [Intune App Wrapping Tool for macOS](https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/intune-app-wrapping-tool-macos):
   `./IntuneAppUtil -c litellm-relay-<version>.pkg -o .`. Then Apps → macOS →
   Add → **macOS app (PKG)** / line-of-business app, upload the `.intunemac`.
2. **Assign.** Assign the app as **Required** to your pilot Azure AD group.
3. **Deploy the PAC profile.** Devices → Configuration → Create → macOS →
   **Templates → Custom**, upload
   [`mdm/litellm-relay-pac.mobileconfig.example`](../mdm/litellm-relay-pac.mobileconfig.example).
   Assign to the same pilot group.
4. **Verify.** Monitor the app install status per device in Intune, then check
   `http://127.0.0.1:4142/` and the Gateway on a pilot Mac.
5. **Broaden.** Change the assignment to the full device group.

Use Intune trusted-certificate profiles only when testing a future managed-CA
MITM mode; the default install trusts Relay's CA in the user login keychain.

## Kandji

1. Upload the `.pkg` as a **Custom App**, audit-and-enforce or install-once.
2. Add a **Custom Profile** with the PAC payload above.
3. Use a Certificate Library Item only for a future managed-CA MITM test.

## Offboarding / uninstall

Ship `src/uninstall.sh` (also in the package payload at
`/usr/local/litellm-relay/uninstall.sh`) as a script/policy, and unassign the
PAC profile so macOS stops using Auto Proxy:

```bash
/usr/local/litellm-relay/uninstall.sh --unset-system-proxy "Wi-Fi" --remove-data
```

## Notes

macOS has a single Global HTTP Proxy payload per device. Customers already using
a corporate proxy need a coordinated PAC file rather than a second competing
profile.

Using `--api-key` (or `gateway.api_key` in the managed config) writes a static
Gateway key to every device. Prefer per-user browser SSO where your Gateway
supports it.

The per-user LaunchAgent re-runs `autoconfigure` at login and on its interval.
Each run checks the stored Gateway credential first. If the Gateway rejects it,
the run leaves the Codex, Claude Code, and Claude Desktop configs untouched and
exits non-zero, so an expired SSO session shows up in the LaunchAgent's exit
status and in the `credential` block of `/api/status` instead of being rewritten
into the tools every hour. The check also covers the saved key Claude Desktop
falls back to when it is not given OIDC flags, so an IdP setup cannot copy a
rejected key into the desktop app. `/api/status` reflects the credential
currently saved in `config.yaml`, so re-running `litellm-relay setup` updates
the dashboard without restarting Relay
